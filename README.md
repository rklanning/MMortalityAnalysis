# **Race and Maternal Mortality**
## Fall 2023
## This project aims to utilize the _Pandas_ package in Python to examine what risk factors (if any) relate to maternal mortality outcomes for black and white mothers. This process consisted of cleaning the data, subsetting by race, creation of a demographics table, and chi-square tests of association between BMI, WIC access, age, education, and maternal mortality. 
## As one of my first projects in the realm of Biostatistics, this was an inspiration to continue work in unpacking outcome disparities observed across many sectors of public health.
